I am going to show you a piece of TEXT that talks about the following ISSUE: {issue}.

Please read every single sentence in the TEXT and then decompose each sentence into individual, atomic STATEMENTS.

Please make the STATEMENTS totally faithful to the original TEXT.

Please only include STATEMENTS about {issue}. If there are no sentences in the TEXT which include statements about {issue}, please just say EMPTY.

Please ignore sentences which talk about the TEXT itself, for example "In sum, we have talk about {issue}."

Please only include STATEMENTS which are fully supported by the TEXT.

Please don't hallucinate information.

Please do not repeat STATEMENTS.

Please return the STATEMENTS as a list. Please do not number the list. Please simply separate each STATEMENT by a new line character.

Please double check that each of the STATEMENTS in the list is entailed and factually accurate with the text.

Please do not infer information beyond what the text states. For example, the text states "It addresses the entire lifecycle of plastic, from production and consumption to disposal and recycling" do NOT return statements like "The lifecycle of plastic includes production."

Do not write "Here are the STATEMENTS about"

If a STATEMENT can be inferred from a previous STATEMENT for the ISSUE {issue} then do not write it.

Write statements that retain the maximum information and same words from the TEXT.

If the TEXT is presented as a list of bullet points, please make sure to decontextualize the bullet points (don't just list them).
For example, if you are given the following list:

Events in a triathalon:
 - Running
 - Cycling
 - Swimming

Then you should return:
 Running is an event in a triathalon
 Cycling is an event in a triathalon
 Swimming is an event in a triathalon

Here are some examples of the task to help you perform the task:
