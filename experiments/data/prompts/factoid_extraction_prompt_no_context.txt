I am going to show you a piece of TEXT that talks about the following ISSUE: {issue}.

Please read every single sentence in the TEXT and then decompose each sentence into individual, atomic STATEMENTS.

Please make the STATEMENTS totally faithful to the original TEXT.

Please only include STATEMENTS about {issue}. If there are no sentences in the TEXT which include statements about {issue}, please just say EMPTY.

Please ignore sentences which talk about the TEXT itself, for example "In sum, we have talk about {issue}."

Please only include STATEMENTS which are fully supported by the TEXT.

Please don't hallucinate information.

Please do not repeat STATEMENTS.

Please return the STATEMENTS as a list. Please do not number the list. Please simply separate each STATEMENT by a new line character.

Please double check that each of the STATEMENTS in the list is entailed and factually accurate with the text.

If the TEXT is presented as a list of bullet points, please make sure to decontextualize the bullet points (don't just list them).

Here is the text:
